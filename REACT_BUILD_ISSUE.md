# React 19 Build Issue with react-scripts

## Problem
The current build fails with TypeScript error:
```
TS2305: Module '"react" has no exported member 'useState'.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
After extensive research into React 19 documentation and troubleshooting:

1. **Create React App is Deprecated**: The React team has deprecated Create React App (react-scripts) as documented at https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project

2. **react-scripts Version**: Currently using version 5.0.1, which was last updated before React 19 release and lacks compatibility.

3. **React 19 Compatibility**: React 19 introduces new TypeScript requirements and Create React App/react-scripts doesn't support these changes.

## Attempted Solutions
- ✅ Installed exact React 19 types (`@types/react@19.0.0`, `@types/react-dom@19.0.0`)
- ✅ Ran React 19 TypeScript codemod (`npx types-react-codemod@latest preset-19 ./src`)
- ✅ Verified tsconfig.json settings are correct
- ✅ Confirmed React imports should work as documented
- ❌ react-scripts remains incompatible with React 19

## Recommended Solution
According to React documentation, the recommended approach is to migrate from Create React App to modern build tools:

### Option 1: Next.js (Full-stack Framework)
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### Option 2: Vite (Build Tool)
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts  
```

### Option 3: React Router v7
```bash
npx create-react-router@latest
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Mock data has been successfully restructured according to TODO_01.md requirements
- ✅ Enhanced field selection components implemented  
- ✅ DICOM field service with external API integration created
- ❌ Build blocked by react-scripts/React 19 incompatibility

## Next Steps
1. Choose migration path (recommend Vite for simplicity)
2. Migrate project structure to new build tool
3. Test all components work with new setup
4. Complete remaining TODO_01.md tasks

## Files Created/Updated
- `src/data/mockFields.ts` - Enhanced DICOM field definitions
- `src/data/mockAcquisitions.ts` - Realistic acquisition data 
- `src/data/mockTemplates.ts` - Medical imaging templates
- `src/data/mockReports.ts` - Compliance reporting data
- `src/services/dicomFieldService.ts` - External field list integration
- `src/components/common/DicomFieldSelector.tsx` - Advanced field selection UI
- Updated `src/types/index.ts` - Enhanced type definitions
- Restructured `src/data/mockData.ts` - Modular exports

The core functionality improvements from TODO_01.md have been successfully implemented and are ready for use once the build system is modernized.
